ADS environment for calaculating statistics, metrics, histograms.

usage:

The module is imported as

    import adsstats

and the data to be returned is specified in a comma-separated string like e.g.

    return_types = 'statistics,metrics,histograms,series'

and the bibcodes for which to return the data need to be in a list. If this list
is 'bibs', then the data are generated by

    results = adsstats.generate(bibcodes=bibs, types=return_types)

The function 'generate' returns a JSON object with results. If 'types' is omitted in the
call, the function is executed with the default types (defined in the 'local_config' file).
